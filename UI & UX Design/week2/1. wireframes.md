Wireframes are basic blueprints that help teams align on requirements, keeping UX design conversations focused and constructive. Think of your wireframe as the skeleton of your app, website, or other final product. Your wireframe shows the design team and stakeholders the bare-bones outlines of essential webpages, components, and features, including:

- Screen layouts
- Navigation bars
- Components of UX and UI design
- Interactive elements

At the early stages of design, low-fidelity wireframes rely on lorem ipsum text and simple boxes as placeholders for images and videos. This helps the design team, copywriters, and other team members to focus on basic functionality to align around the right direction.

Starting with a clean, spare wireframe design also gives UI/UX designers room to iterate. They can collect early feedback from user testing on core UX/UI elements, without distracting users with visual design details. Design teams try out different concepts, user flows, and templates as they work toward the ultimate user experience.

You can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4NyQ5iOMF0) for a tutorial to start wireframing.

An effective wireframe can be as simple as a napkin sketch or as complex as a static product mockup. By applying these  best practices in wireframe design, you can align on directions with your team faster, and move forward with the best approach.

## Steps to start and finish wireframing

**1. Identify your design goals.**

Before you start sketching or tinkering with wireframe templates, name your design goals. Consider user needs, and what actions you want them to take to achieve them. Maybe you can help the user to solve a problem by buying a helpful product, or by signing up for an educational newsletter. Align your design team around this goal, so that your wireframe designs advance that cause.

**2. Choose the right size for your wireframe**.

Your wireframes should match the size of the screen your target audience will be using. Naturally, a website or application will look different on a laptop than it would on a mobile device. With that in mind, standard wireframe sizes for screen types are as follows:

- Mobile: 1080 pixels wide by 1920 pixels long
- 8” Tablet: 800 pixels wide by 1280 pixels long
- 10” Tablet: 1200 pixels wide by 1920 pixels long
- Desktop: 768 pixels wide by 1366 pixels long\

**3. Keep your wireframe design simple.**

Start your wireframe using grayscale colors, limiting fonts, and replacing graphics with boxes. Make sure your blueprint meets the user requirements at the most basic level. If you focus on details like misspellings or color schemes, you might overlook a flaw in the user experience. For simple early-stage designs, truncated previews or cards may suffice.

**4. Maintain design consistency**.

Wireframes shouldn’t cause distraction or confusion. Similar components should look the same across all wireframes, so they're easy to grasp, iterate on, and code. Even if there’s a slight variation between two related components, different designs can create uncertainty for developers across pages and iterations.

**5. Make navigation obvious**.

Your user flows should be fluid and intuitive.  As you apply information architecture to your wireframe, consider where you might need to support it with navigation and wayfinding cues. If users have to consult a sitemap, your navigation and information architecture need improving.

You can refer to [this video](https://youtu.be/zoxkTqhHfds) to see how to ensure navigation works properly in your wireframe.

**6. Don’t get too attached to your wireframe**.

Even a high-fidelity wireframe is still a rough draft that needs changes to become a final product. Once your design team finalizes the wireframe design, it’s time for collaboration with developers and other creative team members to add functionality.

**7. Leverage wireframing tools.**

Design teams need wireframes they can share, save, and turn into mockups online. [Figma's free wireframing kit](https://www.figma.com/templates/wireframe-kits/) comes with drag-and-drop design tools that make it easy for beginners and design pros alike to create customized, high-fidelity wireframes.
