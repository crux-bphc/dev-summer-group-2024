# Week 2 Task

Build a wireframe for the website you decided to upgrade last week. (Examples: instagram, spotify, erp, etc)

This is an example of how a wireframe of the same application would look:

Keep all the problems you had identified with the original design in mind and find solutions to them in your wireframes. You can refer to other wireframes from the internet that have can spur some inspiration in your layouts.

You can change the entire layout if you feel the current one is flawed.

Think about your layout decisions and good luck!
