# Analysis

You are given a current user interace. See if you can figure out the issues and an appropriate solution with the interface.

## UI/UX process and design

Assess -> Design -> Build -> Assess again

There are some questions you must ask about your design to make it a better design.

- Value
- Usability (Can users do what they need to do?)
- Adoptability (How easy is it for the user to start using the device? Is it )
- Desirability (Is it pleasant to use?)

What do users need? Does this design fulfill those needs?
How do they do it?

We'll have a closer look at how humans process design and how to understand decision making:

- [Nudge Theory](https://www.businessballs.com/improving-workplace-performance/nudge-theory/)
- [BJ Fogg's Behavioral Model](https://behaviormodel.org/)
- [Human-Centred Design](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/human-centered-design/)

# Case Studies

## Instagram

See instagram's UI evolution [here](https://haikalrzn.medium.com/evolution-of-instagrams-ux-ui-6f8cced3f1f) and [here](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/instagram-and-its-evolution-24f0f64eb713). Notice the differences in UI over the years and how they change to fit instagram's needs.
