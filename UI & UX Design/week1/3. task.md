# Your Task

## 1. Get comfortable with the figma software

We will mostly be using Figma for the duration of this workshop, and we'll have a short introduction to figma for you here.

You can read [this](https://designlab.com/figma-101-course/introduction-to-figma) article to get started with the software

You can also refer to [this](https://youtu.be/wIuVvCuiJhU?si=lAzAydAhOquMvJa1) Youtube Video

## 2. Your Project

We will work through step 1 of recreating a website. As you've learnt, you will analyse a website of your choice and identify the issues with it. Choose wisely as this will be the website you will be redesigning as your project for the workshop.

You can take the help of the case studies we have presented and existing case studies online to guide you with the process of finding issues and creating appropriate solutions them.

Record your entire analysis on a document.
