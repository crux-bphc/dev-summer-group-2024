# Arrangement and Layout

The layout is the structure that supports the visual components of an interface. It works opening the paths where the sight can shift to group, rank and make sense of the information. It also helps the content to highlight what is the most important data on the site. The layout function, thus, is invisible to the user but relevant to navigation.

A good layout design relates to objectives, reflected in a good user experience. That is why we can say that a correct layout makes the user find what he is looking for. This is also reflected in more task accomplishment and more time on the site

You can go through the patterns given below or check out [this link](https://uxdesign.cc/fundamentals-of-layout-in-interface-design-ui-3a9dba31f1) to see what design principles one can adopt to further engagement.

Standard patterns and existing products are helpful sources of inspiration for designing layouts. Common layouts use visual design and Gestalt principles. User-Interface Design Design patterns are repeating solutions to prevalent challenges in design. Designers can communicate using design patterns as a shared language. They allow for discussion of alternatives, where simply mentioning the name of a design pattern has far more weight than just the name.

Here are a few common web layouts:

### Grid

A grid layout works well for designs that have a lot of similar elements, such as this course catalog page. There are many cards, as each represents a course. Placing the cards on a grid keeps them organized and allows users to easily scan them.

### Split

A **split-screen** layout is a good option for dividing a page into two distinct sections. This page is divided into information (left side) and action (right side).

### Single-Column

A **single-column** layout can work well for text-heavy pages. The article text is displayed in a wide column that takes up most of the page.

There are a number of layouts and ways in which information can be distributed, the most important rule is to keep it simple. The vast majority of users are not in an interface by design, but by the information contained in the design. After all, complex structures are difficult to understand.

While it is not an easy task to be able to combine esthetic principles and the science of cognitive processes, the correct use of both is essential for professional UI design. If we are going to tackle a new project, let us remember to give ourselves the necessary creative freedom, but always based on a structure that the user recognizes, and that has been proven to work.
