# Components

A UI component is a distinct element with some specific function within a user interface.

Types of components:

1. Input Controls: Allows user to input information.
2. Navigational Components: Helps a user move around a website.
3. Informational Components: Holds information.
4. Containers: Holds related content together.

A dropdown presents a compressed way of choosing an option from a set of options. It is similar to radiobuttons, but allows a the choices to be compressed into a box for cleaner user interface. This is efficient when there are a lot of options in the set.

#### Hamburger Menu

The hamburger menu is a form of navigation menu that hides navigation links from the main page. Instead, the user simply clicks on the hamburger icon to view the menu and explore the other pages from there. This is marked by a menu icon which consists of three horizontal lines stacked on top of one anotherâ€”like layers of a hamburger.

#### Kebab Menu

The kebab menu is similar in concept to and is inspired by a hamburger menu. It is three dots, representing the elements of a kebab.

<details>
  <summary>How is a kebab menu different from a hamburger menu then?</summary>
  
  Here's Google's answer:

- Hamburger Menu: Often used for internal navigation. It might contain links to different sections of the same application or website (e.g., Home, Profile, Settings, Notifications).
- In contrast, the kebab menu is typically for the overflow menu, or external navigation (ex: visit our blog).

</details>

#### Meatball Menu

The meatballs menu icon is a horizontal menu, unlike the vertical orientation of the others.

![meatball menu](https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design-every-common-ui-menu-icon/attachment/meatballs-menu-icon-evolution/)

It is also called the ellipsis menu, due to its design similarity to the three dots of grammatical function in writing.

This menu is mostly used to open up additional options. Meatball menus, once clicked, contain links to related items or related actions not seen on the main screen.

### Paginations

![pagination](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Tk0DldorcoyL923BhnOs9A.png)

A pagination helps a user navigate from one page to another. It allows the content to be divided into pages, which helps with larger sets of data.

Tabs are used to organise content into different sections within the same page. These can be navigated by clicking the tab you want to navigate to.

## Informational Components

### Icons

Icons are small graphical representations used to symbolise actions or objects. They use intuitive visual cues using images that represent the icon's function to help the user navigate. Icons can represent functions like editing, deleting, saving, or navigating to different sections.

[Icons can be used as buttons as mentioned here](https://m3.material.io/components/icon-buttons/overview)

#### Icon libraries

Icon libraries are collections of predefined icons that designers and developers can use in their projects to maintain consistency and save time. These libraries provide a wide range of icons covering various categories and use cases.

Some popular icon libraries include [Material Icons](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/), [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/), [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/).

### Loading and Progress Indicators

### Modal

![modal image](https://blog-static.userpilot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/welcome-modal-ui-examples.png)

A modal is a type of container that appears on top of the main content of the UI, sometimes dimming the background. This allows to focus the user's attention on a specific task or piece of information. They are used often in cases where they want a user's attention before allowing the user to return to the main interface.
