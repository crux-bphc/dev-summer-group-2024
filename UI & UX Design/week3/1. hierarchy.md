# Visual Hierarchy

What is visual hierarchy?

It affects what you look at and focus on in a design. It's a key player in determining how information is organised and displayed for easy understanding and navigation.

What do we want to draw attention to? What actions do we want our users to take?

## Bad visual hierarchy

If every element seems important than no element is important. It essentially ranks the information you will be consuming as a user. The user must be able to differentiate between the elements.

Here, first you see the big blue box and then the orange button. This is an example of call to action. You can see more about it here [CTA.](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-examples?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fvisual-hierarchy&hubs_content-cta=call%20to%20action)

We want to be able to grab the user's attention and guide the users journey. We can achieve this with good visual hierarchy.

## Size and Scale

Users notice larger elements easily. Size refers to the element's dimensions and scale refers to its relative proportion relative to other elements on the page.

A large logo would create a focal point and less prominent elements can be grouped together with a smaller size in order to let other elements get more attention.

Make the elements that you want your user to look at first the largest. Use that to guide what you want them to look at next.

### Hierarchy in font

Hierarchy in font can also be used. You can use primary, secondary and tertiary font sizes that are different enough to create a proper hierarchy in the web design.

Primary text can be used with buzzwords to attact the user. Secondary text can be subheadings that do not stand out as much as the primary text but helps guide your gaze along the page. Tertiary text would provide more detailed information.

## Colour and contrast

People are drawn to colours. Colours evoke a particular emotion and have meanings associated with them from cultural and social connotations. For example, food company's logos tend to be yellow and financial associations tend to be blue.

Contrasting the colours helps the colours stand out. It calls for attention for a particular element over the other.

Here, the 2 orange bars stand out from the gray bars indicating that orange is the focus point and grey is secondary.

Creating a contrast between elements is especially helpful when you are using a call-to-action.

## Whitespace

White space, or negative space prevents too many elements from cluttering the layout.

Less is more as filling the space with too many elements confuse viewers.

[Here's](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/white-space-design/) some examples where whitespace has been used correctly and benefits the website's layout.

## Reading Patterns

In most western cultures it is normal to read from left to right. We can use this information to strategically place our information in the design we create.

Here are the primary reading layouts following natural reading patterns:

The Z pattern and F pattern are shown here. An F pattern is more readily seen in crowded layouts with lots of information (text-heavy). The Z pattern puts a visual cue at each corner, logo or call-to-action.

## Proximity and Repetition

The human brain seeks out patterns naturally. Placing web elements next to each other or in a particular pattern helps visitors to understand how they are related or what their purpose is. For example, putting elements together tells the user that the elements are related.

The closely grouped boxes in the above image hints to the user that they all likely have a similar level of importance.
