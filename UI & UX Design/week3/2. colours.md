## How to and how not to use colours

Think about the use case, what kind of colours do the users want to see in the web design? And how much of it do they want to see?

Here's an example where too much colour was used. There is not much of a balance maintained here and it gets hard for the user to keep up with what the website is expressing.

Here's an example of color being used well in a design.

## How to make a colour scheme

How can I ensure I use enough but not too much color in my designs?

### What is this rule?

The 60-30-10 rule is a rule that helps to guide designers on choosing and pairing colours for their designs.

This rule says that the dominant/primary colour should take up 60% of your design, the secondary colour should take up 30%, while an accent colour should take up 10% of your design.

## Why 60-30-10?

### Emphasises key elements in the design

The dominant colour draws attention to larger surfaces and establishes the overall mood of the design.The seconday colour supports it.

The tertiary colour highlights specific features of the design.

### Visual Balance

The rule achieves visual balance by ensuring that one colour does not overpower the other. There is a sense of equillibrium and balance which is achieved with the percentages.

### Simplicity

Having 3 established colours allows for the design to be simple and avoids confusion and overwhelming combinations.

## How to choose the colours

Think about this. What does the colour I'm using mean? What does it convey?

### More tips and tricks on exactly how to implement colours

1. Grayscale first. You can lose a lot of time by applying colors too early. Focus on spacing and laying out elements before
2. Contrast the text. Make it readable by contrasting with the background
3. Donâ€™t use pure gray or black. It is more natural to add some saturation. We rarely see pure gray colors in real life

Also note: the rule is not a strict requirement and can be adjusted to suit individual preferences and design goals.
