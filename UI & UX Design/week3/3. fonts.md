UI/UX design relies on typography, shaping information, mood, and user experiences. The choice of font is crucial, in making or breaking a project. Typography is so much more than choosing a nice font for your website or app; it’s the art of using typefaces to bring your interface to life. With so much to consider when working with typography, including readability, accessibility, and hierarchy, your use of typography could mark the difference between a good interface and a great one.

Typography is important for website design because:

1. Captures Attention:
   While bad typestyles reduce legibility, an attractive typeface will draw people in and encourage them to start reading or engaging with a website or brand.

2. Influences Behavior:
   Poor typefaces turn people off, often causing them to ‘bounce’ from your website and back to a search engine. However, when paired with compelling language and visuals, good fonts and spacing can persuade users to spend longer engaging with the content, brand, or products on your website.

3. Supports Brand Recognition:
   Typeface works with logos and other visual elements to propel a brand identity. Over time, people can subliminally relate a typeface with a brand which helps to build trust and recognition.

4. Helps Create a Visual Hierarchy:
   Typography can act to create structure and clear signposting within content, which in turn naturally helps direct attention to the most important aspects. In a world that’s increasingly time poor, this is important for users and helps designers to direct people to the most salient information.

When users first arrive on a webpage or app, they scan the page rather than reading it. Having a clear hierarchy, and clean typefaces are essential for creating an excellent first impression with the user—and ultimately, keeping them on the page.

Once you’ve caught your users’ attention, the next challenge is about conveying information. As people are accustomed to receiving information in text form, it’s a UI designers’ responsibility to ensure the typeface helps to convey the message rather than distract from it.

## Hierarchy and Consistency

The use of typefaces, styles, and font sizes can also be used to create a hierarchy which organizes text. Establishing this hierarchy is crucial to typography. For example, a larger typeface may indicate a header or sub header, which helps readers to navigate through the text easily. Breaking up text into paragraphs with different font sizes helps users to scan through content and locate key pieces of information quickly and more effectively.

Being consistent and organized with how different typefaces and fonts are used is key to preventing text being seen as messy, disorganized, confusing, or unappealing for the user. A good designer will create a hierarchy of styles which dictates when fonts, sizes, and formatting should be used for different types of information, paragraphs, headings, subheadings or sections of text. Readers should subliminally notice the formatting pattern, helping them to more easily navigate the text—that is, provided the hierarchy is adhered to and built to be consistent and without too many layers.

## White Space

‘White space’ is the empty space surrounding text or graphics. It’s typically the color of the page’s background. White space can be altered around text by changing margins, padding, line spacing, or surrounding graphics. While it may seem like a small element of design, the space between words and objects can have a large impact on the legibility of text and the page’s overall look and feel. Used correctly, increasing white space can also draw the eye to key text.

## All About Fonts:

The rule of thumb for a good UI font is **legibility and readability.**

- Legibility refers to how well one individual letter or character can be distinguished from another in a typeface. Legibility is everything, and choosing the right font will significantly impact the overall user experience of your mobile apps. If someone cannot discern between an 0 and an O, or if they’re squinting trying to read a line of text, then it’s a clear sign of incorrect typography.

- Readability refers to how words and blocks of text are arranged in a design. It’s all about spacing words and sentences to allow the user to easily interpret and understand content in a way that makes sense.

### Base font size

Base font size refers to the primary or default font size used in an app or a website.Most modern UI designs use a base font size of 16px, and you’ll often see it used for body paragraphs, lists, or menus. 16px as a default is a good place to start, as it’s easily legible for users to read on a screen.

### Line height and X-height

X-height refers to the distance between the baseline and the mean line of lowercase letters in a typeface. For example, a font with an x-height of 70% means that the baseline is 70% of the entire height of the font.

In UI design, generally, 68–69% is considered optimum for readability and legibility. Typefaces and fonts with tall x-heights are better legibility at small font sizes, as the whitespace within each letter is more legible.

### Other miscellaneous terms

“Serif” refers to the small line, mark, or “tail” that appears at the end of different letters. It’s become the collective name for fonts and typefaces that use serifs in their design.

Sans-serif is a typeface designed without serifs (its name literally translates from French to “without serif”). Sans-serif fonts are favored by UI designers the world over owing to their lower stroke contrast, larger x-heights, and overall reduced cognitive noise.

Grotesque was the first form of sans serif type, getting its name from its irregular and awkward shape. A more refined version of grotesque, called neo-grotesque, was popular in the mid-20th century.

## Introduction to popular fonts and where to use them:

1. Inter: Inter is a Google font and easily the most popular UI design font. Inter has a very distinct look and has come to be known as a standard font within UI. Inter shines through its excellent legibility, readability, and perfectly symmetrical characteristics in each letter. (also look up Roboto as a replacement for Inter)

2. Montserrat: With its clean lines and geometric design, Montserrat imparts a contemporary feel, rendering it applicable across diverse contexts. It offers an array of weights and styles, providing design flexibility and versatile application. Well-proportioned letters enhance Montserrat’s readability in both small and large sizes.

3. Playfair Display: Playfair Display emerges as the ideal serif font for fashion and editorial contexts. Drawing inspiration from Bodoni, a late-eighteenth-century font, this style of editorial font showcases high-stroke contrast, portraying elegance and grace — qualities beloved in fashion branding. Playfair Display’s key strength lies in its diverse range of weights, allowing for versatile use across various creative materials.

4. Lexend: Lexend was expertly constructed to improve reading speeds, reduce visual strain, and make reading more accessible for those with dyslexia or other reading disabilities. It has since been integrated into UI design as an easily readable font with accessibility at the forefront, although some wider tracking variations (Peta and Zetta in particular) may be too clunky for smaller screens.

\*Don't want to deal with all these fonts? Use system fonts!! The system UI font is the typeface used in the user interface of a device, such as the text that appears on buttons, menus, and other elements in the operating system. It is chosen by the manufacturer of the device and is typically specific to that brand or device. It is different than “system font“ which is any font that is already installed on the user’s device and does not need to be downloaded when accessing a website.
