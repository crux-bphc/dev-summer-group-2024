## Web Development Workshop - Week 2

By now, you should probably have a decent grasp of HTML and CSS. This is a great time to start building things you find cool and experimenting with what you've learnt. 

What you'll be covering next, is the basics of javascript. Javascript is the language of the web, and will give you a lot more power to build the applications you want. Using javascript makes your websites dynamic.

### Resources on Javascript

Javascript is a very useful tool, so I'd highly recommend understanding the things you're learning in depth. To simplify the learning, I'll be dividing up the topics in the following way, and providing links for you to learn these topics.

#### Part 1 - The Javascript Basics
These will help you get started with javascript.

- [An introduction to Javascript](https://javascript.info/getting-started)
- [Javascript fundamentals](https://javascript.info/first-steps)

This section will help you write your first bit of javascript code

#### Part 2 - Objects, Data Types, Advanced functions and Error Handling
Objects are an extremely useful tool that javascript offers. This topic should be learnt with extra attention, as you will be dealing with this very often as you write your web applications. Y
- [Objects](https://javascript.info/object)

You will also need to know about different data types.
- [Data types in Javascript](https://javascript.info/data-types)

This section will help you learn a little more about functions than you knew before, and some other interesting concepts. You do not need to go into a lot of detail with all the topics in this section, but make sure you have an idea of whatever is mentioned here.
- [Advanced working with functions](https://javascript.info/advanced-functions)

Lastly, you will need to know some basic error handling.
- [Error Handling in Javscript](https://javascript.info/error-handling)

At this point, I would also like to mention something that really helps while learning Javascript. In my opinion, common Javscript interview questions are a great resource to foster your understanding of this language. There's a lot to know about this language and things may not always be obvious. Knowing about questions that will test your understanding of the language is therefore really benefecial. 

For now I'd recommend going through the first 10-15 questions of this article, as it tests you on some fundamental concepts - [Javascript Interview Questions](https://www.interviewbit.com/javascript-interview-questions/)

#### Part 3 - Promises, Async and Await
This part of javascript is a slightly tricky one to get a grasp of, but it is worth trying to spend time understanding it, since you will be using these concepts everywhere in your websites. These are some of the resources I'd recommend.

- [Promises in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/RvYYCGs45L4?feature=shared)
- [Promises in 10 minutes by Web Dev Simplified](https://youtu.be/DHvZLI7Db8E?feature=shared)
- [Async- Await explained by Web Dev Simplified](https://youtu.be/V_Kr9OSfDeU?feature=shared)
- [Promises, Async and Await](https://javascript.info/async)
#### Part 4 - DOM Manipulation

DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation in JavaScript refers to the process of dynamically changing the content, structure, and style of a web page using JavaScript
These are some of the resources I ll recommend
- [DOM Manipulation by Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y17RuWkWdn8) 
- [Javascript DOM explained](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/) (I would only recommend looking at sections 1,2,4,6 and 7(till focus events))

You don't need to focus too much on the details of DOM manipulation because when you start using React, you'll rely less on it.
#### Some other resources to aid you
These will further hone your skills for writing good javascript code.

- [A resource on spreading and destructuring in javascript](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-destructuring-rest-parameters-and-spread-syntax-in-javascript)
- [Fireship's 12 minute video on 100 javascript concepts you need to know](https://youtu.be/lkIFF4maKMU?feature=shared)


### Put it into practice

Now that you've built a strong foundation in javascript, it is time for you to put it into practice. One of the best ways to do this is to build games, but really it could be anything you want to build.

Here's a playlist that contains tutorials on building Javascript games.
- [Javascript game tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej8SatOj3V4&list=PLnKe36F30Y4bLhA-st9sC4ZthyV7nsL2Q)

Here's a coding challenge where you can practice using promises and async/await.

### Conclusion

That's it for week 2! It is a lot of content, but you can take as much time as you want to understand these concepts about Javascript. It's more important to build a strong foundation than actually rushing through all the articles and resources given above. Take your time, and have lots of patience. 

Once again, keep building applications as you learn. Writing code well and learning to deal with errors and bugs is crucial. See you next week!
