## Web Development Workshop - Week 1

Welcome to your web development journey! I hope that you guys will have a fun time learning web development during this workshop and enjoy the process of building web applications and websites.

### Some details about what you're gonna learn and some things you might wanna know

Roadmaps on web development you see these days might daunt you. These roadmaps often tell you that you might have to learn technologies and stacks like the popular MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node) and numerous other technologies, and to some extent, yes, they're right. But before that, you have to know HTML, CSS and Javascript. There is a lot to cover and there is a lot to learn and discover as you go about learning Web Development. No matter how far you are in your journey of Developing stuff, you will always discover something new to learn. A great mindset to have while learning any form of development and its related technologies is being interested to learn, and building small applications to augment your learning.

So, what is the point here? The point is that, there's a lot to learn, but there's always some application or website you can be building at any stage of learning. As you learn and build something fun, you acquire experience and knowledge under your belt. I'll say it again, building things you find fun alongside what you learn will make you learn the fastest and will make you a better developer in the long run. And remember, you can always build something cool, even if you just know HTML or CSS.

### Why are there so many technologies, tutorials, courses and ...

Web development is a huge field. There's a lot of technologies and that's because different technologies cater to the needs of different people. There's a lot of tutorials because there's a lot of concepts you can learn as you learn newer technologies and there's a lot of courses because people have different ways of teaching and learning. In my opinion, if you're following this workshop, you shouldn't be asking for the help of any courses or particular youtube playlist or something that will teach you all of webdev in a month. That's not gonna happen, and the best way to learn is to read documentation, read articles about stuff you don't understand, hop over to StackOverflow every 2 minutes to figure out what went wrong again and keep building stuff. Watch Youtube playlists we've linked (or use anything that's fairly popular on Youtube) to understand and learn. Really, any method of learning, whether docs, playlists or books or whatever is fine, as long as you understand what's going on and are building websites.

### A Breakdown

This section will give you an overview of what we're gonna be learning as a web developer and what you might need to learn as a web developer, whether in this workshop, or after we're done with the workshop.

#### Part 0

This section briefs you about the internet and the web.
What is the web and how it works.

#### Part 1

This section is by far the most important one, and the most basic. It is the foundation for all of web development. You can make any website using just these 3 technologies.

-   **HTML** - The language of the web

-   **CSS** - How the web is styled

-   **JS** - To make the web dynamic and interactive

-   **Typescript (Optional)** - This makes debugging your Javascript applications easier and adds types, like you would in C++ or Java. You can do this once you're familiar with Javascript and have some experience in web development.

-   **Tailwind CSS (Optional)** - Writing CSS code for your application can be really painful and time consuming. Tailwind CSS make styling easier with the help of utility classes. You can do this after learning HTML and revisit after learning React

#### Part 2

Here is where things begin to branch out. You might want to learn how to make your own web servers, or how to make your frontends look better and add more functionality. Here's a list of stuff you might want to learn. I'll name the most common libraries and frameworks first along with their less popular alternatives and you can choose yourself after a google search or two about what you want to pick and learn.

-   **Frontend libraries and frameworks**
    The Frontend is what the user sees on the browser when they use your application. While you can build everything with HTML, CSS and Javascript, here are some technologies that will make your life much, much easier.

The most popular Frontend Library by far is **React** by Meta. Some alternatives you can choose from include **Svelte, Vue, Solid or Angular**. We'd highly suggest picking React first, then exploring alternatives. You can also explore frameworks that utilise React like **NextJS** or **Vite** which make life even easier while building applications, but do this once you're familiar with React.

-   **Backend - Your servers, databases and a lot more**
    The backend is something the users of your application cannot see. It does all of the magic of interacting with databases that store information, receiving user requests and handing out appropriate responses, authentication (login, signup) and much more.

One of the most commonly used technology to build web servers in your applications is NodeJS. NodeJS makes it possible to run javascript out of the browser and run it on something more familiar, like your code editors (We recommend VS Code). An alternative to NodeJS, could be something like Golang, but we'd once again recommend you sticking to NodeJS till you are familiar with building a web server for your applications.

A package you will use in Node to build your applications is called **Express**. Express makes it possible for you to actually write code and make a web server for your application. There are a few alternatives, but we'd highly recommend using Express in the beginning.

As for databases, there's a lot to choose from and each has its own benefits. But to simplify it, we'll pick 2 popular ones you can learn. Broadly, databases can be segregated into SQL and NoSQL databases.

Here's a few links to help you out.

[A short video explaining SQL and NoSQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ss42Vb1SU4)

To make your decision here easier, we'd recommend going with **Postgres** if you want to use an SQL database and **MongoDB** if you want to use a NoSQL database. Of course, if you want to use anything else you already know or find useful, feel free to.
