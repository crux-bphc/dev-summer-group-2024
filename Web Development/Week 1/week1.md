# Week 1 - The Web, HTML and CSS

I'd recommend beginning with the topic in part 0, how the web works. Here's a small explanation and a few links to help you out.

You want to see a website? Your phone asks the router for a website; the router asks for DNS (Domain Name System: A service that translates website URLs, like https://google.com/, to network addresses). Your phone gets the IP Address of the website (IP Address: A unique, identifying address of a computer on a network). Then, the router asks the ISP (Internet Service Provider: Airtel, BSNL, Jio, etc.) for the contents of what the computer with that IP Address responds with. The data of what the computer responded to is sent to your phone. The website has now loaded on your phone.

After you're done with this, move ahead to HTML and CSS. Remember, DO NOT try to memorise or learn all of HTML and CSS topic by topic by making excessive notes or anything of that sort. These topics are extremely vast and often you'll end up forgetting much of what you had earlier seen. In this case, don't be afraid of Googling things you've forgotten. This makes learning much more efficient. For the first week, focus on learning HTML and CSS and seeing what it can and can not do. Again, remembering all tags and CSS properties is pointless. Read through the material quickly and figure out what's important by building your own apps by watching youtube videos of others building applications and reading through code on online articles or Github.

I would recommend only looking at the following topics: colours, backgrounds, borders, margins, padding, height/width, box model, text, fonts (only font family), max-width, position and the z-index. Don't look at it in depth or try remembering all the properties. Just quickly read through the articles to get familiarised with CSS properties and have an idea of what things are possible with it, you can always come back to look up the specifics.

One particularly important concept in CSS are the flexbox layout and grid layout. These will help you arrange your elements in nicer ways and can help in making your websites' design more responsive and elegant.

If you want to test out your skills, try making a static website with just HTML and CSS. You could try replicating the layout of an existing website you've seen to test your CSS skills or try making something of your own.

This was quite comprehensive, and we don't expect you to understand everything written here in the first go. Understanding comes with time and I hope you continue learning and developing your skills until you are able to understand everything well. Cheers!
