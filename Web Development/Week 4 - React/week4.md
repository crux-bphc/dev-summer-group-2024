## Web Development Workshop - Week 4

This section of the workshop introduces you to React, one of the most popular frontend libraries for building modern frontends today. While we can already build some really cool websites using just HTML, CSS and Javascript, React brings with it a whole new way to build complex websites easier and quicker than just HTML, CSS and JavaScript can.

There is also a large community that is familiar with React and this makes the learning process much easier. React also supports libraries for common functionalities you may need in your application, making it the preferred frontend library for developers.

### Resources on React

Learning React is fun, but you may become very used to seeing some of your code snippets not working as they should more often than not. Before you actually learn React, here are some tips for you.

- Log your responses. Logging literally everything helps while debugging helps. Use the console. methods available in Javascript to do this.
- If something in React does not work as it should, your first step to debugging should be opening the browser console and reading through the errors to find out what went wrong.
- Stack overflow. Once again, this is your best friend if anything ever goes wrong. Stack overflow is flooded with common bugs and errors you may encounter while learning React.

#### Part 1 - The Ultimate Resource
The React documentation is the ultimate resource for React. There is nothing better than the documentation if you want to look up something that is related to React. Even for beginners, it offers very good starter guides to ease your way into learning React.

- [The React Documentation](https://react.dev/)
- [A tic tac toe game in React, from the docs](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

The tic tac toe game is something really cool to get started with.  
    
#### Part 2 - Tutorials
This section will provide you with some good resources apart from the docs themselves that you can start learning React with.

- [A youtube tutorial on React for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk)

This tutorial will get you familiar with what React has to offer, you can now build your basics up from here.


#### Part 3 - Props, State and Hooks
These are some of the core concepts you have to learn while learning React.

- [How to use Props?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-props-in-reactjs/)
- [Props.children, demystified](https://codeburst.io/a-quick-intro-to-reacts-props-children-cb3d2fce4891)
- [State A Component's Memory](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory/)
- [Managing state](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
- [Updating Objects in State](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state)
- [Updating Arrays in State](https://react.dev/learn/updating-arrays-in-state)
- [Controlled vs Uncontrolled components in React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-controlled-and-uncontrolled-components-in-react/)
- [States vs Props](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/reactjs-tutorial/reactjs-state)
- [Hooks, from the React documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks)

#### Week 4 - Conclusion
Learning React is a fun, and is probably your first step towards making that cool website you always wanted to make. We recommend trying out every feature you come across and reading tons of material you find on React. Watching an infinite amount of videos and coding along to a project is also a great way to build your understanding on React and how to write code with it.

Here's a cool project that you can try out for a week or two.

That concludes the material for Week 4, and make sure to keep building cool stuff.
