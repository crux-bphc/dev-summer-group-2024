## Web Development Workshop - Typescript Module

This module is an optional module, and meant for people who are fairly comfortable with Javascript and want to get their hands dirty with Typescript.

### Why Typescript?
First and foremost, for people with some amount of experience in Javascript, Typescript is very easy to pick up. In simple terms, it is just Javascript with a type system.

But Typescript makes it easier to catch errors and bugs in your code early on, in your Code Editor or IDE itself. You don't want bugs in your final application, and Typescript is here to aid you with that. It also makes refactoring easier and introduces serveral other useful features.

#### Resources to help you learn Typescript
These will help you get started with Typescript.

- [Tutorial on Typescript](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/)
- [Typescript documentation - for reference only](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)

The documentation is quite comprehensive, and you don't need to learn it all in one go. You should probably learn the intermediate and advanced concepts as you encounter them or need them. Concepts like Generics and Decorators are useful, but we'd recommend just using the basic features Typescript offers till you're comfortable coding in Typescript. 

Also, do not panic if you encounter a lot of errors as you switch from using Javascript to Typescript, it is perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed when first starting out. Once you encounter an error, Google is your best friend. Good luck!
