# CRUx Machine Learning Workshop 2024

## Introduction

Welcome to the CRUx Machine Learning workshop! I hope you all will have a fun time getting to know more about the world of AI and ML. Before moving on, I would like to let you know that if at any point you have any doubts or questions, feel free to ask them in our [discord](https://discord.gg/q2t4GHvWRW) server.

## Overview & Prerequisites

First, let's talk about the structure of the workshop. We will be releasing content every week or every 2 weeks depending on the difficulty and vastness of the topic in hand. At the end of the week, we will have a small contest/competition on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). This is to give you an opportunity to apply the knowledge that you learn in the workshop. Note that week 1 won't have any competition.

Moving on, regarding the content. ML is a vast field and it primarily comprises of a lot of math. This workshop will not focus much on the math behind various learning algorithms but rather try to give you **hands on experience** on building ML models with the help of libraries like _sklearn_, _tensorflow_, _pytorch_, etc. But for those of you who are curious to know the math behind algorithms, we will be providing links to learn them at your own pace.

The content will contain links/attachments and sometimes ``jupyter notebooks`` too. More about jupyter notebooks later. You will be expected to learn everything in 5-6 days so that you have some time to give to the competition at the end of the week. If the content is heavy, then it can go upto 2 weeks.

## Topics to be covered
1. Basic Python -> NumPy -> Pandas
2. Basic Classification and Regression, feature engineering, preprocessing, cost functions
3. Advance Classification and Regression - Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, random forests
4. Clustering algorithms - KMeans, other miscellaneous - cross validation etc.
5. Intro to Neural networks, TensorFlow

Additionally, if we have time remaining, we can teach a topic that the general crowd wants.

## Learning Outcomes of this workshop

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of machine learning and its applications.
- Apply various machine learning algorithms for classification and regression tasks.
- Perform feature engineering and preprocessing techniques to improve model performance.
- Evaluate and compare different machine learning models using appropriate metrics.
- Implement clustering algorithms for unsupervised learning tasks.
- Gain hands-on experience with popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
- Interpret and visualize machine learning models to gain insights from data.
- Participate in Kaggle competitions and apply learned techniques to real-world datasets.
- Have a solid foundation to further explore advanced topics in machine learning.

## Requirements

You can find the prerequisites and requirements for this workshop in the week 1 folder.

I hope all of you enjoy the learning process and come out to be exceptional ML engineers in the future!

## Discord Server

To facilitate communication with all of you, we have made a discord server for the same. It has been linked above. Announcements in the future will be made in the server. We encourage you to join it and be active in discussions. This will keep us motivated to produce great content for you guys!
