# Week 4 - Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

In the previous weeks, we covered various  classification models. This week, we will explore more advanced machine learning techniques, including Clustering, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Cross-validation. These topics will help you understand how to handle complex data and build powerful models for various tasks.

## Clustering
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together. It helps in identifying patterns and structures in the data without prior knowledge of class labels. The key clustering algorithms we will cover are:

- **K-Means Clustering:** A popular algorithm that partitions the data into K clusters based on the mean of the data points in each cluster.

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
ANNs are computational models inspired by the human brain, used for a wide range of tasks including classification, regression, and pattern recognition. Key concepts we will cover include:

- **Perceptrons:** The basic building blocks of neural networks that can solve simple linear problems.
- **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP):** Networks with multiple layers that can model complex nonlinear relationships.
- **Activation Functions:** Functions like sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU that introduce non-linearity into the network.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
RNNs are specialized neural networks designed for sequential data, such as time series or natural language. They maintain a memory of previous inputs to make predictions. Key concepts include:

- **Vanilla RNNs:** Basic RNNs that can model simple sequences but suffer from issues like vanishing gradients.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
CNNs are designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. They are highly effective for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Key concepts include:

- **Convolutional Layers:** Layers that apply convolution operations to extract features from the input data.
- **Pooling Layers:** Layers that reduce the spatial dimensions of the data, making the network computationally efficient.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Layers that perform high-level reasoning after feature extraction.

## Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It helps in assessing how well the model generalizes to unseen data. Key techniques include:

- **K-Fold Cross-Validation:** The data is split into K subsets, and the model is trained and evaluated K times, each time using a different subset as the validation set.

## Conclusion
In this module, we will delve into the principles, advantages, and limitations of these advanced machine learning techniques. We will also discuss how to implement and evaluate these techniques using real-world datasets.
