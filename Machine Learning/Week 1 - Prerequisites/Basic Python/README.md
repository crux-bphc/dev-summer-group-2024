# Introduction
Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. With its extensive library ecosystem and easy syntax, Python is a great choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. In this README, we will cover the basics of Python programming to help you get started on your ML journey. Let's dive in! 

## Python Basics
This portion covers the very basics needed to get started with python.
1. [Variables](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/variables-constants-literals)
2. [Data types](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/variables-datatypes)
3. [Operations](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/operators)
4. [Type Conversion](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/type-conversion-and-casting)

## Python Lists
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

1. [Create List](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list#create)
2. [Access List](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list#access)
3. [Slice List](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list#slice)
4. [Replace List Elements](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list#change)
5. [Delete List Elements](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list#delete)
6. [List methods](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list#method)

## Functions and Packages
The concept of a function is one of the most important in mathematics. A common usage of functions in computer languages ​​is to implement mathematical functions. Such a function is computing one or more results, which are entirely determined by the parameters passed to it.

2. [Funciton Arguments](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/function-argument)

A package is a container that contains various functions to perform specific tasks. For example, the math package includes the sqrt() function to perform the square root of a number.

While working on big projects, we have to deal with a large amount of code, and writing everything together in the same file will make our code look messy. Instead, we can separate our code into multiple files by keeping the related code together in packages.

2. [Modules](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/modules)

## Flow Control
Flow control is a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to control the execution of your code based on certain conditions. It enables you to make decisions, repeat code blocks, and handle different scenarios. In this section, we will explore various flow control mechanisms in Python, including conditional statements and loops

1. [If..else..](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/if-elif-else)
2. [for loop](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/for-loop)
3. [while loop](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/while-loop)
4. [break-continue](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/break-continue)

This brings basic python to a close. All of these concepts will be crucial tools to help build ML models and do data analysis tasks.
