# Introduction
Welcome to the prerequisites for Machine Learning! In this week, we will cover the fundamental skills you need to excel in the field of ML. We will start by diving into Python, a versatile and powerful programming language widely used in ML. You will learn the basics of Python syntax, data types, control flow, and functions. **If you already know python, you can skip basic python and move on to the next section.**

Next, we will explore two essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis: NumPy and Pandas. NumPy provides efficient numerical operations and multi-dimensional array support, while Pandas offers high-performance data structures and data analysis tools. You will gain hands-on experience with these libraries, learning how to manipulate arrays, perform mathematical operations, and work with structured data.

By the end of this week, you will have a solid foundation in Python, NumPy, and Pandas, setting you up for the world of Machine Learning. So let's get started! 

**Note:** _Basic python doesn't have any notebook associated with it. We have provided links from which you can learn it at your own pace._

## Requirements

- Jupyter Notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks are a popular tool for interactive computing and data analysis. They provide an environment where you can write and execute code, visualize data, and document your work using markdown. The ``.ipynb`` files in the ``Numpy`` and ``Pandas`` folder are jupyter notebooks. 

- **Google Colab**: Google Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment provided by Google. It offers several advantages over a local setup:

1. **No installation required**: With Google Colab, you don't need to install any software on your local machine. You can access Colab directly from your web browser, making it convenient and accessible from anywhere.

2. **Free GPU and TPU support**: Google Colab provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, which are powerful hardware accelerators. This is particularly useful for training machine learning models that require significant computational resources.

3. **Collaboration and sharing**: Google Colab allows you to easily share your notebooks with others and collaborate in real-time. You can also import and export notebooks from and to Google Drive, making it easy to work on projects with teammates.

4. **Pre-installed libraries**: Google Colab comes with many popular libraries pre-installed, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. This saves you the time and effort of installing and managing dependencies.

To start using Google Colab, simply go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) and sign in with your Google account. You can create new notebooks or upload existing ones from your local machine or Google Drive.


#### For those of you who want to use a local setup:

If you don't have python already installed on your system, you can use the Anaconda distribution to install python and jupyter together.

Here is a guide for windows: [Anaconda for python and jupyter Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUeBzT43JyY)

Here is a guide for MacOS: [Anaconda for python and jupyter MacOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM60D-Pg890)

If you are experienced with python, you can install it using the following pip command:

```
pip install jupyter
```

Once installed, you can start a Jupyter Notebook server by running the command:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface, where you can create and open notebooks.

Here is a guide : [Jupyter guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-jupyter-notebook-an-ultimate-guide/)

**You will also need to install the libraries yourself**

To install NumPy and Pandas, you can use the following commands:

```shell
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
```

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your machine before running these commands.

## How to use the notebooks provided

The notebooks teach you how to use numpy and pandas in an interactive way with the help of markdowns. We will first talk about the topic and then proceed to code it. 

### What do you have to do?

It's very simple. You can go through the entire notebook once by yourself. After that make your own notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or your local notebook and practice just the code part once by yourself.
