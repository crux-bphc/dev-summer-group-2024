### Introduction to pandas

You can find all the content for pandas in the notebooks above. They have been marked in the order you are supposed to read them.
1. ``1_intro.ipynb``
2. ``2_missing_data.ipynb``
3. ``3_summary_statistics.ipynb``
4. ``4_combining_dataframes.ipynb``

The ``datasets`` folder contains all the datasets that will be used in the notebooks.

You can ignore the ``assets`` folder. It just contains images that are used to explain concepts.
